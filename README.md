# Cypress React

This project has a sample React application that uses Cypress for E2E testing.

This project has pages for:

- Forms
- Lists
- HTTP Requests

This project is a companion to my YouTube video

This project is also a companion repo to my blog post [How to use Cypress for E2E with React](https://rhythmandbinary.com/post/2021-03-15-how-to-use-cypress-for-e2e-with-react).

The original project was rebuilt from my repo at https://github.com/andrewevans0102/learn-cypress

To start the project do the standard `npm install` and then check out the `package.json` file for the corresponding scripts to run cypress and the project.
